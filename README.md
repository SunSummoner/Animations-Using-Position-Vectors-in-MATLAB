# Animations-Using-Position-Vectors-in-MATLAB

This project was done by Kritika Verma and Siddhartha Mahajan under Dr. Sonam Tanwar during the course of their Linear Algebra paper during second semester.
It focuses on plotting differential equations
and discrete dynamical systems using MATLAB. Along
with animation of these systems which depicts their
growth with respect to time.
